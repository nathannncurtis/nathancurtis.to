 Scent of Salt

Too deep —
barely breathing.
Cursed to swim,
not float.

Current pulls —
further,
deeper,
The shore whispers,
horizon taunts.

Soon to sink.
To drown.

I am a wick —
forced to burn,
doomed to smoother.

Haunted by breath —
that clogs, not clears.

Lungs will fill —
with smoke or salt.
Full.

Waves don’t wait
for sand or stone.
Treading’s for survival —
not life.

Arms, soon to give.
Legs will quit.
The sea will take me.

A body once known,
turned depths lurking.
The salt will claim me.
