        <p>
          My title is Process Development Specialist. The reality of the role is broader: I operate across software, infrastructure, production hardware, and people. When systems break or processes stall, I'm usually the one brought in to map the problem, stabilize the environment, and implement a long-term solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a litigation support company, my work spans automation tooling, internal software, OCR pipelines, infrastructure administration, and production hardware maintenance. When a document processing pipeline fails, the diagnosis might land on a DNS misconfiguration, a corrupted TIFF header, a Kyocera fuser issue, or a script that choked on an edge case. Usually it's several of those at once. The reason I'm effective is that I can trace problems across all of those layers &mdash; not just the one that happens to be "my job."
        </p>
        <p>
          I build automation tools in Python, PowerShell, JavaScript, and Go. I administer Active Directory, Group Policy, DNS/DHCP, NAS systems, and firewalls. I perform full maintenance kits on production printers and integrate them into imaging workflows. I build internal dashboards, desktop utilities, and data-driven interfaces. These aren't separate jobs &mdash; they're all part of understanding the environment well enough to actually fix it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That infrastructure literacy is the differentiator. Plenty of people can write scripts. Fewer understand the network, the hardware, and the organizational workflows that the software has to survive in. I work cross-departmentally because problems don't stay inside org chart lines, and the most impactful solutions are the ones that connect systems together rather than optimizing them in isolation.

          I write <a href="poetry.html">poetry</a>. It's how I process what I can't debug. Different discipline, same honesty requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also make music &mdash; that side of things is still coming together. More on that eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The short version: I'm a person who builds things, fixes things, and occasionally writes about what it feels like to do both.
