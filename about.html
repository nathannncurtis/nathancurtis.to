        <p>
          My title is Process Development Specialist, but the reality is wider than that. I'm the person who maps messy environments, connects departments and tooling, diagnoses failures across layers, and builds the systems that hold everything together.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a litigation support company, I build automation tools, internal software, OCR pipelines, and production workflow systems. When a document processing pipeline breaks at 2 AM, I'm the one figuring out whether it's a network path issue, a corrupted TIFF header, a printer firmware bug, or a script that choked on an edge case. Usually it's three of those at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work across Python, JavaScript, PowerShell, PHP, and Go &mdash; not because I'm chasing languages, but because real problems don't respect language boundaries. The right tool depends on what you're connecting: a desktop app needs PyQt5, a server script needs PowerShell, a web dashboard needs JS, and a CLI tool that needs to be fast needs Go.
        </p>
        <p>
          I operate at the intersection of automation, production operations, infrastructure, and technical troubleshooting. I'm not just a script writer &mdash; I understand how entire systems fit together, from Active Directory and DNS to printer firmware and network shares. That cross-layer visibility is what lets me solve problems that don't fit neatly into a single team's domain.
        </p>

          I write <a href="poetry.html">poetry</a>. It's how I process what I can't debug. Different discipline, same honesty requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also make music &mdash; that side of things is still coming together. More on that eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The short version: I'm a person who builds things, fixes things, and occasionally writes about what it feels like to do both.
