 Still walking.

To what —

to where?

It’s unbecoming;

just walking.


The leaves rustle,

the humidity just so.

There —

a shadow scurries across the path.


Just a rat —

a mouse maybe.

Hurriedly running from a faint flutter —

a whisper of wings —

a “who” echoes — alone.


Pine muddles the senses

The wind

shouting from the valley afar.


For the trees:

they’re listening — laughing.


But they do not speak,

nor cast judgment.

For they cannot

with their lungs filled with sap.


They cannot breathe alone,

yet they preserver all the same.

For their yearning’s not for novels —

but for rings


While the granite lies again exposed,

and the moss now looks west.

And the trees still chuckle,

with a new grin on the same grain .


Now the branches feel like family,

and all the timber gathers near.

The trees continue dancing —

like they always do.


“Have I seen that one before?”
