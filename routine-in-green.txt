 Click click —

the mint approaches.

A simple feeling:

an ache masked in flavor.


Click click —

the tube running low,

a soft charade

of bliss.


The temptation of tongue,

the dread of the teeth.

Click click —

no twist left —

wasting.


As the lips cry their wear,

the thumb plays that rhythm.

Click click —

the relief dwindles.


Balm seals the creases —

a crack no more.

As the click click

grows distant.


A cheap motion,

in object, in cost.

A purpose: routine —

a callous click click.


For the green distracts,

the mint soothes the pain.

Click click —

just for me.
